# Introduction to IoT {#intro}

The IoT is the product of physical objects, controllers, sensors and actuators and the internet [@mcewen_designing_2013]. The first reference to the IoT was in 1982, when researchers at Carnegie Mellon University developed the world’s first IoT-enabled Coke Machine. Mark Weiser developed the concept further in the early 90s; and Kevin Ashton coined the term ‘Internet of Things’ around 1999.
